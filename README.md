Like [yakstack](https://pypi.org/project/yakstack/), but with a more tree-like structure to support parallel yaks.

Also written in CL because I feel like it.

All the hard work is actually done by cl-ansi-term, up to the point that I didn't even bother implementing a proper way to represent the current yak so it's just whatever entry ends with an asterisk.

It is very important not to confuse a yak with a [musk ox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXo1vCKTEQg).

Is there some kind of award for "least helpful README"?
